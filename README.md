# ZAsync
Replacement for the default AsyncTask. Has similar interfaces, but added support for caching to make your code more readable


# Installation

Add this in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
  
  
Add the dependency in your app build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.zunjae:ZAsync:0.4'
}
```

# Usage:

```java
@Nullable
private DogAsyncTask asyncTask;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    asyncTask = new DogAsyncTask(this);
    asyncTask.setForceSkipCache(false); //optional
    asyncTask.execute();
}

---

private class DogAsyncTask extends ZAsync<Dog> {

    public DogAsyncTask(Activity activity) {
        super(activity);
    }

    @Override
    public void onPreExecute() {
        // show notification
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasCache() {
        return DogRepository.hasDogSaved();
    }

    @Override
    public Dog returnCache() {
        return DogRepository.getDogFromRepo();
    }

    @Override
    public Dog doInBackground() {
        return DogRepository.getMockDogFromCloud();
    }

    @Override
    public void onPostExecute(@Nullable Dog dog) {
        // dismiss notification
    }
}
---

    // optional cancel listener
    @OnClick(R.id.cancelButton)
    public void onCancelButtonClicked() {
        if (asyncTask != null) {
            asyncTask.cancel();
        }
    }

```

# Note

* It is required to add a constructor calling the superclass
* No need to cancel the ZAsync from the onDestroy method. This now happens for you. If you do need to cancel the AsyncTask, call .cancel()
